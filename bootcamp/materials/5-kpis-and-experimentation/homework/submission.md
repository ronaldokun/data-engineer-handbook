## Pick a product that you love using:
    - My picked product is RescueTime: rescuetime.com
##  Describe the user journey of the things you loved about it from the moment you started using it to your use of it now:

- I don't remember exactly where I've heard about Rescuetime, but I've been using it for a long time. I've always been interested in productivity tools, and Rescuetime is one of the best tools I've found. I started using it because I wanted to track my time and see how I was spending it. I was also interested in knowing how much time I was spending on different websites and applications. I ahve broad areas where I want to work on, like "Dad Time", "Software Development" and "Foreign Language". These areas have non-negotiable minimum expenditure time for me. Despite not being overly anxious or fanatic about my productivity, to see how I actually spend my time and attention gives me a sense of control, even though I almost never optimize the use of my time as I should sometimes it shows I am actually spending a good amount of time on something that I wanted to, even if it doesn't seem like it. I also like the weekly reports that I receive by email, the numerous aggregation metrics, trends and visualization tools as well as the APIs and cross-platform availability. I am not consistent at all in most of my tools and habits, but Rescuetime is one of the few that I've been using for years. In fact it can tell me exactly how much time I've been using it: That's 3 years, 5 months, 8 days, 7 hours, 9 minutes, and 25 seconds!

## Describe 3 experiments you would like to run on this product to see if it would improve the experience
- You should detail out the allocation of each test cell and the different conditions youâ€™re testing
- Your hypothesis of which leading and lagging metrics would be impacted by this experiment

Based on the user journey described, I'll propose three experiments that could enhance RescueTime's value proposition of helping users understand and optimize their time usage while maintaining the sense of control without inducing anxiety.

### Experiment 1: Dynamic Goal Adjustment
**Hypothesis**: Automatically suggesting goal adjustments based on historical patterns will increase user engagement and goal achievement rates.

**Test Conditions**:
- Control Group (33%): Current static goal-setting interface
- Test Group A (33%): Weekly smart goal suggestions based on historical patterns
- Test Group B (34%): Real-time goal adjustments with positive reinforcement messaging

**Leading Metrics**:
- Goal adjustment acceptance rate
- Weekly active usage duration
- Number of custom categories created
- Goal check-in frequency

**Lagging Metrics**:
- Monthly user retention
- Goal achievement rate
- User-reported satisfaction scores
- Premium subscription conversion rate

### Experiment 2: Focus Time Integration
**Hypothesis**: Introducing automated focus time blocks based on productivity patterns will increase productive time spent in prioritized categories.

**Test Conditions**:
- Control Group (50%): Standard time tracking
- Test Group (50%): Smart focus time suggestions with calendar integration and automatic Do Not Disturb mode activation

**Leading Metrics**:
- Focus session acceptance rate
- Average focus session duration
- Number of successfully completed focus sessions
- Focus mode activation rate

**Lagging Metrics**:
- Time spent in user-designated high-priority categories
- User productivity score
- Cross-platform engagement
- Feature adoption rate in premium tier

### Experiment 3: Social Accountability Features
**Hypothesis**: Adding optional peer accountability features will increase engagement with the platform and improve goal adherence.

**Test Conditions**:
- Control Group (40%): Current individual tracking
- Test Group A (30%): Anonymous peer benchmarking with similar user profiles
- Test Group B (30%): Opt-in accountability partnerships with weekly progress sharing

**Leading Metrics**:
- Partner connection acceptance rate
- Weekly progress sharing rate
- Benchmark comparison engagement
- In-app messaging activity

**Lagging Metrics**:
- Long-term user retention
- Goal completion rates
- Net Promoter Score
- Social feature adoption rate

Each experiment includes appropriate guardrail metrics to ensure we don't negatively impact the core value proposition:
- Daily active usage shouldn't decrease
- User-reported anxiety levels shouldn't increase
- Core feature engagement shouldn't decline
- Privacy preferences must be maintained

These experiments are designed to enhance the aspects that the user specifically valued - the sense of control, flexible goal setting, and long-term consistency - while introducing new features that could further improve the experience without compromising these core benefits.
