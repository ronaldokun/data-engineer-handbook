**Fact Data Modeling Fundamentals** 

*   **What is a fact?** A fact is an atomic event that cannot be broken down further , . Examples include a user logging in, making a purchase, or clicking a notification , , .  The "who," "what," "when," and "where" aspects are crucial for modeling facts , , , . The "how" can also be important, representing the method or process .
*   **Fact data volume:** Fact data is significantly larger than dimensional data due to the sheer number of user actions , , .  This can lead to substantial cloud costs .
*   **Data quality:** Fact data should have quality guarantees, including no duplicates and non-null "what" and "when" fields , .  Data types should be simple (strings, integers, decimals) , avoiding complex structures like large JSON blobs .
*   **Normalization vs. Denormalization:**  There's a trade-off between normalized and denormalized facts , , . Smaller datasets benefit from normalization, while larger datasets may require denormalization for efficiency , , .
*   **Deduplication:** Deduplication is a significant challenge with fact data , , , , , , .  Techniques like streaming and micro-batching can help , , .  Duplicates can arise from bugs in logging or genuine repeated actions , .
*   **Bucketing:** Bucketing is a powerful technique for handling high-volume fact data , , .
*   **Reduced Facts:** Reduced facts minimize data volume by preserving essential information, enabling faster analysis , .

**Fact Data Modeling**

This summary focuses on fact data modeling, specifically using examples from NBA game data.  The goal is to create efficient data structures for quick analytical queries.  A key distinction is made between facts (aggregated data) and dimensions (grouping attributes).  However, the line between them can be blurry , , , , .  Dimensions are used for grouping in queries (e.g., `GROUP BY` in SQL) , while facts are the values aggregated (summed, averaged, etc.) .

**Dimension Examples:**

*   `dim game date`: The date of the game , .
*   `dim team ID`:  The unique identifier for a team , , .
*   `dim player ID`: The unique identifier for a player , , .
*   `dim player name`: Player's name , .
*   `dim is playing at home`: Boolean indicating if the team played at home , , .
*   `dim did not play`, `dim did not dress`, `dim not with team`:  Boolean flags indicating player availability , , , .
*   `dim start position`: Player's starting position , , .
*   `dim season`: The NBA season , .


**Fact Examples:**

*   `m minutes`: Minutes played (converted to fractional representation for better analysis) , .
*   `m fgm`, `m fga`, `m fg3m`, `m fg3a`, `m ftm`, `m fta`: Field goals made/attempted, three-pointers made/attempted, free throws made/attempted , , , .
*   `m orb`, `m drb`, `m reb`: Offensive, defensive, and total rebounds , .
*   `m assist`, `m steal`, `m block`, `m turnovers`, `m personal fouls`, `m points`, `m plus minus`:  Assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, points scored, and plus-minus , , .

This summary describes a method for efficiently storing and querying user activity data using bit manipulation techniques.  The goal is to determine daily, weekly, and monthly active users without the performance overhead of querying large datasets.

**Data Structure:** The core concept is a `DAT list int` , which represents a user's activity history as a single integer. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a day, with a '1' indicating activity and a '0' indicating inactivity .  This allows storing 30 days of history in a single 32-bit integer , achieving significant compression .  The most recent day is represented by the least significant bit .

**Data Preparation:** The process begins with a table containing user IDs and their active dates .  A cumulative table is created, tracking user activity history .  This involves iteratively adding new activity data to the existing history .  The data is initially stored as an array of dates , which is then converted into the `DAT list int` representation.

**Bitwise Operations:**  The conversion to `DAT list int` involves using bitwise operations.  The `pow(2, day_index)` function generates powers of two corresponding to each active day . These powers of two are then summed to create the final integer representation .  Bitwise AND operations are used to efficiently check for activity within specific time windows (e.g., last 7 days for weekly active users) . The `bit_count` function counts the number of set bits (1s) in the integer, indicating the number of active days .

**Querying:**  Queries for daily, weekly, and monthly active users are performed using the `bit_count` function and comparisons against thresholds . This approach avoids the need for expensive `GROUP BY` operations on large datasets, minimizing `Shuffle`  and improving query performance .  The use of `select`, `from`, and `where` clauses without window functions further enhances parallelism .

**Considerations:** The method uses 32-bit integers, limiting the historical data to 32 days.  For longer periods, larger data types or alternative approaches would be necessary .  The choice of 28 days for a month is mentioned as a way to reduce seasonality .  Data quality issues, such as null values, need to be addressed .



**Data Models and Aggregation Strategies**

This summary explores different data models and aggregation techniques for handling high-volume data, focusing on optimizing query performance and scalability.  The discussion centers around three key schemas: fact data, daily aggregates, and reduced facts.

**Fact Data (, ):** This model is highly granular, storing individual events with detailed attributes like user ID, action, date, and device.  It's highly flexible for detailed analysis () but suffers from high volume, leading to slow queries and potential out-of-memory errors for large timeframes ().

**Daily Aggregates (, ):** This schema aggregates data at a daily level, significantly reducing volume.  Each record represents a user's metrics for a given day and metric type ().  This improves query speed for questions about recent activity (), but longer time horizons can still be challenging ().  The example walkthrough demonstrates building this model using array aggregation, handling edge cases with `COALESCE` and `ARRAY_FILL` functions (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).

**Reduced Facts (, , ):** This model further reduces data volume by storing aggregated metrics as arrays, typically monthly ().  This significantly improves query speed for recent data (), but sacrifices flexibility in the types of questions that can be answered ().  The trade-off is between speed and the ability to ask detailed questions over longer time horizons (, ).  The example shows how this model can be used to address problems with slow queries and backfills (, , ).

**Optimizing Queries**

The discussion also highlights strategies for optimizing query performance, particularly concerning the use of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses.  `ORDER BY` at the end of a query requires a global sort, impacting parallelism and performance (, , ).  `GROUP BY` causes shuffling of data across machines (<
