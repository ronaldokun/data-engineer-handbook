## Who is the primary and secondary owners of these pipelines?
For critical data pipelines that feed into investor reporting and experimentation, we need a robust ownership model. A good practice is to assign both primary and secondary owners based on expertise and pipeline complexity:

Engineer A - Financial Domain Expert
Engineer B - Data Modeling Specialist
Engineer C - User Acquisition Specialist
Engineer D - Retention Metrics Expert

### Profit

The profit pipelines require deep understanding of business metrics and financial data. I'd suggest pairing engineers where one has strong financial domain knowledge with another who excels at data modeling. Engineer A is the primary owner and Engineer B is the secondary owner.

### Growth

The growth pipelines would benefit from owners who understand user acquisition and retention metrics well. Let's assign Engineer C (primary) and Engineer D (secondary) as owners here, allowing them to maintain consistency between daily and aggregate reporting.

### Engagement
The engagement pipeline could be owned by Engineer D (primary) and Engineer B (secondary), leveraging their experience with aggregate metrics while providing good coverage.

## What is an on-call schedule that is fair? (Think about holidays too!)

Each engineer would take one week of primary on-call duty followed by one week of secondary backup. This creates a four-week rotation cycle. During major holidays, I'd recommend implementing a holiday-swap system where engineers can trade shifts based on their preferences. 

### Example of Holiday-Swap
If Engineer A is scheduled for Christmas week but celebrates the holiday, they could swap with Engineer C who might prefer to take New Year's week instead. The key is to plan these swaps at least two months in advance and document them clearly.

### Critical factors to consider for the on-call schedule
- Religious and cultural holidays vary among team members
- Some engineers might have family in different time zones
- Consider implementing a "follow-the-sun" model if team members are in different locations
- Include compensation time for holiday coverage
- Build in buffer time between rotations for knowledge transfer

## Regarding Potential Pipeline Issues:

### Unit-Level Profit Pipeline (Experimentation)
**Purpose**: Provides granular profit data at the transaction or user level to support A/B testing and experimental analysis.

**Primary Owner**: Engineer A (Financial data expertise)

**Secondary Owner**: Engineer B (Data modeling expertise)

**Data Processed**: 
- Individual transaction records
- Cost allocation data
- User-level revenue information
- Product-specific margin calculations

**Specific Issues**:
- Granularity mismatches between cost and revenue data
- Delayed cost allocation updates affecting experiment results
- Sampling bias in transaction processing
- Cost attribution errors in multi-product transactions
- Real-time calculation limitations for rapid experimentation

### Aggregate Profit Pipeline (Investor Reporting)
**Purpose**: Generates consolidated profit metrics for investor presentations and financial reporting.

**Primary Owner**: Engineer A (Financial data expertise)

**Secondary Owner**: Engineer B (Data modeling expertise)

**Data Processed**:
- Consolidated revenue streams
- Operating costs and overhead
- Regional financial data
- Currency exchange rates

**Specific Issues**:
- Currency conversion timing inconsistencies
- Regional reporting delays affecting global aggregations
- Quarter-end adjustments not being properly reflected
- Historical restatements requiring full reprocessing
- Regulatory compliance requirements varying by region

### Aggregate Growth Pipeline (Investor Reporting)
**Purpose**: Provides high-level growth metrics for investor communications.

**Primary Owner**: Engineer C (Growth metrics specialist)
**Secondary Owner**: Engineer D (Data pipeline optimization)

**Data Processed**:
- User acquisition data
- Market expansion metrics
- Revenue growth patterns
- Year-over-year comparisons

**Specific Issues**:
- Seasonality adjustments not properly applied
- Market definition changes affecting historical comparisons
- Acquisition channel attribution errors
- Complex cohort calculations breaking during processing
- Integration issues with marketing attribution systems

### Daily Growth Pipeline (Experimentation)
**Purpose**: Delivers daily growth metrics for rapid decision-making and experimentation.

**Primary Owner**: Engineer C (Growth metrics specialist)
**Secondary Owner**: Engineer D (Data pipeline optimization)

**Data Processed**:
- Daily user signups
- Product adoption metrics
- Short-term retention data
- Campaign performance data

**Specific Issues**:
- Time zone handling affecting daily cutoffs
- Real-time data ingestion delays
- Incomplete data for same-day reporting
- Mobile app data synchronization issues
- Campaign tracking code inconsistencies

### Aggregate Engagement Pipeline (Investor Reporting)
**Purpose**: Measures and reports user engagement metrics for investor updates.

**Primary Owner**: Engineer B (Data modeling expertise)

**Secondary Owner**: Engineer A (Financial data expertise)

**Data Processed**:
- User activity logs
- Feature usage statistics
- Session duration data
- Platform-specific engagement metrics

**Specific Issues**:
- Definition changes in engagement metrics
- Cross-platform data consistency
- Bot traffic contamination
- Session calculation errors
- Data volume spikes during peak usage

### Critical Considerations for All Pipelines:

**Monitoring Requirements**:
- Real-time alerts for data quality issues
- SLA monitoring for investor-facing reports
- Data freshness tracking
- Processing time anomaly detection

**Documentation Needs**:
- Detailed data lineage
- Business logic documentation
- Dependency mapping
- Recovery procedures
- Stakeholder communication templates

**Emergency Response Protocol**:
1. Initial assessment guidelines
2. Stakeholder notification procedures
3. Rollback protocols
4. Data correction workflows
5. Post-incident review processes

This detailed breakdown provides on-call engineers with a comprehensive understanding of each pipeline's context and common issues. Each pipeline has its unique challenges, but they all share the need for careful monitoring, clear documentation, and robust emergency response procedures. The ownership model ensures that expertise is properly aligned with pipeline requirements while maintaining adequate coverage through the primary and secondary owner structure.
