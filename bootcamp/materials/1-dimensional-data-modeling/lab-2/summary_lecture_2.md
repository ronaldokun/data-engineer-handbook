*Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) and Idempotency - Summary*

*Definition:* A slowly changing dimension is an attribute that changes over time. For example, a person's favorite food can change from lasagna to curry over the years. 00:01 - 00:32

*Types of Dimensions:*
  - *Stable Dimensions:* Attributes that do not change, such as a person's birthday.
  - *Changing Dimensions:* Attributes that evolve over time, requiring careful modeling to track changes . 00:30 - 01:02

*Importance of Idempotency*
  - *Idempotency:* Refers to the ability of data pipelines to produce the same results regardless of when they are run. This is crucial for data quality and consistency in analytics . 00:59 - 03:49
  - *Consequences of Non-idempotent Pipelines:* If a pipeline is not idempotent, it can lead to discrepancies in data, causing confusion and mistrust among analytics teams . 03:55 - 04:26

*Challenges of non-idempotent pipelines:* 04:29 - 06:12
  - Silent failure! You only see it when you get the data inconsistently. 
  - They are propagated downstream: If some data depends on the output of a non-idempotent pipeline, that data also would not be idempotent.

*Best Practices for Building Item Potent Pipelines*
  1. *Avoid Insert Into Without Truncate:* Using `INSERT INTO` without clearing previous data can lead to duplication and non-idempotency . 06:17 - 07:09
  2. *Use Merge and Insert Overwrite:* These methods help maintain idempotency by ensuring that data is updated correctly without duplication . 07:10 - 08:50
  3. *Implement Proper Date Ranges:* Always include both start and end dates in your queries to avoid unbounded data retrieval, which can lead to inconsistencies . 08:54 - 10:21
  4. *Check for Complete Input Sets:* Ensure all necessary input data is available before running the pipeline to avoid incomplete data processing . 10:24 - 11:16
  5. *Avoid Dependencies on Past Data:* Design pipelines to run independently without relying on previous data states to prevent inconsistencies . 11:22 - 12:55

*Characteristics of non-idempotent pipelines:*
  - Relying on the "latest" partition of a not properly modeled SCD table. 13:10 - 16:56
  - Relying on the "latest" partition of anything else. 16:59 - 17:33

*Consequences of non-idempotent pipelines:* 
  - Backfilling causes inconsistencies between the old and restated data and it's very hard to troubleshoot bugs. 18:33 - 19:10
  - Unit testing cannot replicate the production behavior. 19:14 - 19:44
  - Silent Failures. 19:47 - 20:14


*Modeling Slowly Changing Dimensions* 
  - *Types of SCDs:*
    - *Type 0:* Fixed dimensions that do not change (e.g., a person's birth date) . 30:07 - 30:40
    - *Type 1:* Only the latest value is stored, which can lead to loss of historical data and is not idempotent . 31:05 - 31:37
    - *Type 2:* Maintains historical data with start and end dates for each change, allowing for accurate backfilling and idempotency . 32:05 - 33:56
    - *Type 3:* Stores current and original values but loses historical context if changes occur more than once, making it non-idempotent . 34:28 - 35:45

*How to load a type 2 SCD table:*  37:16 - 40:20
  - Load the entire history in one query
    - Inefficient but nimble
    - 1 query and you are done
  - Incrementally load the data after the previous SCD is generated.
    - It has the same `depends_on_past` constraint. 
    - It's efficient but cumbersome

*Conclusion on SCDs*
  - *Modeling Considerations:* When deciding how to model a dimension, consider the frequency of changes. The slower the change, the more efficient the model can be . 22:30 - 23:10
  - *Best Practices:* Use Type 2 for most cases to ensure idempotency and maintain historical accuracy, while Type 1 should be avoided in analytical contexts due to its limitations . 35:53 - 36:38
