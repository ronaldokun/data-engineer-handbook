### Step-by-Step Breakdown - Exercises 1 and 2

#### **1. Why Do We Need Cumulative Data?**
- The goal is to build a table (`actors`) where each year's data is accumulated based on:
  - The actor's previous years’ records.
  - The current year's new data (if any).
- This cumulative approach enables tracking trends over time, such as:
  - How the number of movies and their ratings evolve for an actor.
  - Whether the actor is still active (`is_active`).
  - How their performance (`quality_class`) changes year by year.

---

#### **2. Table Structure**
- The `actors` table has fields for:
  - `actorid` (unique identifier).
  - `actor` (name of the actor).
  - `films` (array of movies, each with details like rating and votes).
  - `quality_class` (star, good, average, bad).
  - `is_active` (whether the actor made movies in the current year).
  - `current_year` (tracks the year).

**Why this structure?**
- The `films` array groups multiple movies for each actor, which is convenient for cumulative tracking.
- `quality_class` is derived dynamically based on movie ratings, giving us an aggregated measure of performance.
- `is_active` helps monitor an actor’s engagement year by year.

---

#### **3. Code Explanation**

Let’s examine the code block by block.

---

### **A. `last_year` CTE**
```sql
WITH last_year AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM actors
    WHERE current_year = 1969
)
```

**Purpose:**
- Select the existing data for actors from the previous year (`1969`).
- This is the base we will build upon for the current year (`1970`).

---

### **B. `this_year` CTE**
```sql
this_year AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        actor,
        ARRAY_AGG(ROW(film, votes, rating, filmid)::films_struct ORDER BY rating DESC) AS films,
        1970 AS current_year
    FROM actor_films
    WHERE year = 1970
    GROUP BY actorid, actor
)
```

**Purpose:**
- Fetch new data for actors based on movies released in the current year (`1970`).

**Key Elements:**
- **`ARRAY_AGG`**: Groups all movies for an actor into a single array. This is useful for actors who worked on multiple movies in a single year.
- **`ROW` with `films_struct`**: Packages each movie's details (`film`, `votes`, `rating`, `filmid`) into a structured object. This structure is needed because we store multiple movies in the `films` array field.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Ensures that each actor (`actorid`) has only one row in the result, even if they worked on multiple movies.

---

### **C. `unnested_films` CTE**
```sql
unnested_films AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        actor,
        current_year,
        UNNEST(films) AS film_details
    FROM this_year
)
```

**Purpose:**
- Breaks apart the `films` array into individual rows for processing.

**Key Elements:**
- **`UNNEST(films)`**: Expands the array into multiple rows, where each row contains a single movie (`film_details`).
- **Why `UNNEST`?** Aggregations like `AVG()` (average rating) need the ratings in separate rows, not bundled in an array.

---

### **D. `computed_quality_class` CTE**
```sql
computed_quality_class AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        actor,
        AVG((film_details).rating) AS avg_rating,
        CASE 
            WHEN AVG((film_details).rating) > 8 THEN 'star'
            WHEN AVG((film_details).rating) > 7 THEN 'good'
            WHEN AVG((film_details).rating) > 6 THEN 'average'
            ELSE 'bad'
        END::quality_rating AS quality_class
    FROM unnested_films
    GROUP BY actorid, actor
)
```

**Purpose:**
- Calculates the actor’s performance (`quality_class`) based on the average rating of their movies in `this_year`.

**Key Elements:**
- **`AVG((film_details).rating)`**: Calculates the average rating by extracting the `rating` field from the `film_details` struct.
- **`CASE` Statement**: Classifies performance into one of four categories based on the average rating.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Aggregates ratings by actor to compute one quality classification per actor.

---

### **E. Final `INSERT` Statement**
```sql
INSERT INTO actors (actorid, actor, films, quality_class, is_active, current_year)
SELECT 
    COALESCE(ty.actorid, ly.actorid) AS actorid,
    COALESCE(ty.actor, ly.actor) AS actor,
    CASE 
        WHEN ty.films IS NULL THEN ly.films
        WHEN ly.films IS NULL THEN ty.films
        ELSE ly.films || ty.films
    END AS films,
    COALESCE(cqc.quality_class, ly.quality_class) AS quality_class,
    ty.current_year IS NOT NULL AS is_active,
    COALESCE(ty.current_year, ly.current_year + 1) AS current_year
FROM last_year ly
FULL OUTER JOIN this_year ty ON ly.actorid = ty.actorid
LEFT JOIN computed_quality_class cqc ON ty.actorid = cqc.actorid;
```

**Purpose:**
- Combines `last_year` (previous data) and `this_year` (new data) to populate the cumulative table.

**Key Elements:**
- **`COALESCE`**: Ensures data continuity by using:
  - `this_year` data (`ty.*`) if available.
  - `last_year` data (`ly.*`) otherwise.
- **Appending `films`**:
  - If an actor worked on movies this year, combine (`||`) their previous films (`ly.films`) with this year’s (`ty.films`).
  - If they didn’t, retain their last year’s films.
- **`is_active`**:
  - `TRUE` if the actor has movies in `this_year`.
  - `FALSE` otherwise.
- **`current_year`**:
  - If new data exists (`ty.current_year`), use it.
  - Otherwise, increment the previous year (`ly.current_year + 1`).

---

### **Summary of Flow**
1. **Fetch Historical Data (`last_year`)**: Retrieve the cumulative records from the prior year.
2. **Fetch New Data (`this_year`)**: Get all actors' movies for the current year.
3. **Process New Data (`unnested_films`, `computed_quality_class`)**:
   - Break movies into rows for detailed processing.
   - Calculate the actor’s performance based on movie ratings.
4. **Combine Data (`INSERT`)**:
   - Merge last year’s data with this year’s, updating `films`, `quality_class`, and `is_active`.

---

### Why This is Effective
- **Cumulative Tracking**: Tracks every year's data while preserving historical context.
- **Scalable Design**: Handles arrays (films) and aggregates efficiently.
- **Dynamic Metrics**: Automatically recalculates performance metrics (`quality_class`) yearly.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown - Exercise 3

Creating the `actors_history_scd` table for implementing **Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** involves designing a table that tracks changes in `quality_class` and `is_active` for actors over time, using `start_date` and `end_date` fields to manage historical validity.

---

### **Type 2 Dimension Basics**
1. **Purpose**: Type 2 SCD tracks the historical state of dimension attributes. Instead of overwriting existing records, it creates a new record each time an attribute changes.
2. **Key Features**:
   - **`start_date`**: Indicates when the record became effective.
   - **`end_date`**: Indicates when the record was replaced (or is active if `end_date` is `NULL`).
   - **`is_current`**: Boolean flag to indicate the currently active record.

---

### **DDL for `actors_history_scd`**

Here’s the SQL to create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE actors_history_scd (
    actorid TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Unique identifier for each actor
    actor TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Name of the actor
    quality_class quality_rating,       -- Performance quality class
    is_active BOOLEAN,                  -- Whether the actor is active
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,           -- When this record became effective
    end_date DATE,                      -- When this record was replaced, NULL if current
    is_current BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,    -- Indicates whether this is the current record
    PRIMARY KEY (actorid, start_date)   -- Composite key for tracking history
);
```

---

### **Explanation of Table Design**

1. **Primary Key**:
   - The combination of `actorid` and `start_date` ensures uniqueness for each historical state of the actor.

2. **Fields**:
   - `actorid`: Unique identifier for the actor.
   - `actor`: Actor’s name.
   - `quality_class`: Tracks changes in performance classification.
   - `is_active`: Tracks the actor’s activity status over time.
   - `start_date`: Marks when the record became valid.
   - `end_date`: Marks when the record was replaced. If `NULL`, it’s the current record.
   - `is_current`: Makes it easy to query the active record for an actor.

3. **Default Values**:
   - `is_current` defaults to `TRUE` for simplicity when inserting new records.

---

### **Populating the Table**

When creating or updating this table based on the `actors` table, follow these principles:
1. **Insert a New Record**:
   - Add a new row for the actor when `quality_class` or `is_active` changes.
2. **Update Historical Records**:
   - Set the `end_date` of the previous record to the day before the new record’s `start_date`.
   - Mark the previous record’s `is_current` as `FALSE`.

---

### **Example of Usage**

Here’s how you might populate or update this table dynamically:

#### **Insert New Records**:
```sql
INSERT INTO actors_history_scd (actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT 
    actorid,
    actor,
    quality_class,
    is_active,
    current_date AS start_date,  -- Use the current date for the new record
    NULL AS end_date,           -- End date is NULL for active records
    TRUE AS is_current          -- Mark as the current record
FROM actors
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM actors_history_scd
    WHERE actorid = actors.actorid 
      AND is_current = TRUE 
      AND quality_class = actors.quality_class
      AND is_active = actors.is_active
);
```

#### **Update Historical Records**:
```sql
UPDATE actors_history_scd
SET 
    end_date = current_date - 1,   -- Set the end date to the day before the new record’s start_date
    is_current = FALSE            -- Mark as a historical record
WHERE actorid IN (
    SELECT actorid
    FROM actors
) 
AND is_current = TRUE
AND (quality_class, is_active) IS DISTINCT FROM (actors.quality_class, actors.is_active); -- Only update if changes exist
```

Great question! No, `SELECT 1` is **not the same as `SELECT *`**, and their purposes are different. Let me explain:

---

### **`SELECT 1`**
1. **Purpose**:
   - `SELECT 1` is a common convention used to **test for the existence of rows** in a subquery.
   - It’s used because the specific values of the rows are irrelevant; only the presence of rows matters.

2. **Why `1`?**:
   - Any constant value can be used (`1`, `0`, `'X'`, etc.), but `1` is a widely accepted convention because it is simple and intuitive.

3. **Performance**:
   - PostgreSQL's query optimizer ignores the value (`1`) in the `SELECT` clause when used with `EXISTS` or `IN`. The engine stops processing as soon as it finds a match, so it’s efficient.

4. **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 1
   FROM actors_history_scd
   WHERE actorid = 'actor123'
     AND is_current = TRUE;
   ```
   - This query simply checks if there is a row where `actorid = 'actor123'` and `is_current = TRUE`. The result of `SELECT 1` will be `1` if such a row exists or empty if not.

---

### **Why Use `SELECT 1` in Subqueries?**
In a query like:

```sql
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM actors_history_scd
    WHERE actorid = actors.actorid 
      AND is_current = TRUE 
      AND quality_class = actors.quality_class
      AND is_active = actors.is_active
);
```

- The **goal** is to check whether there’s an active record (`is_current = TRUE`) in the `actors_history_scd` table that matches the given `actorid`, `quality_class`, and `is_active`.
- **`SELECT 1`** is sufficient for this purpose since we only care about the existence of the row, not the data in it.

---

### **Summary**
- Use `SELECT 1` for **existence checks** in `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, or similar scenarios.


### Step-by-Step Breakdown - Exercise 4

Actors with only one record naturally align with Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions' requirements: they represent a single, ongoing state. Here’s how to ensure this edge case is handled properly:

---

### **Understanding the Edge Case**

#### Scenario
For an actor who has only one record in the `actors` table:
- Their `start_date` is the date of their first (and only) record.
- Their `end_date` should remain `NULL` since the record is still active.
- Their `is_current` should be `TRUE`.

#### Example

| actorid | actor      | quality_class | is_active | start_date | end_date | is_current |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|
| A001    | Actor One  | star          | TRUE      | 1970-01-01 | NULL     | TRUE       |

---

### **Handling This in the Query**

The SQL query already handles this edge case correctly with the use of `LEAD()` and a `CASE` statement for `is_current`. Here’s why:

1. **`LEAD()` Behavior**:
   - For actors with only one record, `LEAD(start_date)` will return `NULL`.
   - This naturally leaves the `end_date` as `NULL` because there is no subsequent record.

2. **`CASE` Statement for `is_current`**:
   - The `CASE` checks if `LEAD(start_date)` is `NULL`. If it is, the `is_current` field is set to `TRUE`.

Let’s look at the specific parts of the query:

---

### **Key Query Components**

#### **Determining `end_date`**
```sql
LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY actorid ORDER BY start_date) - 1 AS end_date
```
- For actors with only one record:
  - `LEAD(start_date)` returns `NULL`.
  - Subtracting `1` from `NULL` results in `NULL`.
- This ensures `end_date` remains `NULL`.

#### **Determining `is_current`**
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY actorid ORDER BY start_date) IS NULL THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
END AS is_current
```
- For actors with only one record:
  - `LEAD(start_date)` is `NULL`, so the `CASE` sets `is_current = TRUE`.

---

### **Test Case for Verification**

Let’s test it with a simplified `actors` table containing one record for a single actor:

#### Input (`actors` Table)
| actorid | actor      | quality_class | is_active | current_year |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| A001    | Actor One  | star          | TRUE      | 1970         |

#### Query Output
| actorid | actor      | quality_class | is_active | start_date | end_date | is_current |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|
| A001    | Actor One  | star          | TRUE      | 1970-01-01 | NULL     | TRUE       |

This result demonstrates the proper handling of single-record actors: their `end_date` is `NULL`, and `is_current` is `TRUE`.

---

### **Verification and Best Practices**

1. **Partitioning Validation**:
   - Ensure that the `PARTITION BY actorid` clause in the `LEAD()` function is present. This is critical for isolating each actor's timeline.

2. **Date Handling**:
   - Confirm that `start_date` and `end_date` are properly cast as `DATE` to avoid unintended behavior with `NULL` values in `TIMESTAMP` contexts.

3. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test with actors having:
     - Multiple records (ensure correct transitions between `start_date` and `end_date`).
     - Single records (ensure `end_date` is `NULL` and `is_current = TRUE`).

---

### **Final Note**

The logic provided already incorporates this edge case seamlessly. If your database contains actors with only one record, they will automatically receive the correct `end_date = NULL` and `is_current = TRUE` in the resulting `actors_history_scd` table.

Let me know if you’d like to run through further edge cases or test cases together! 😊

### Summary for exercise 5

To implement an **incremental query** for updating the `actors_history_scd` table, we need to combine the existing data (historical records) with new data from the `actors` table while preserving the Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) logic.

---

### **Key Steps for Incremental Updates**
1. **Identify Changes**:
   - Compare the `quality_class` and `is_active` values in the `actors` table with the most recent (`is_current = TRUE`) record in `actors_history_scd`.

2. **Handle Changed Records**:
   - If `quality_class` or `is_active` has changed, mark the existing record as historical by setting its `end_date` and `is_current = FALSE`.
   - Insert a new record with the updated values.

3. **Handle Unchanged Records**:
   - If there’s no change, leave the existing record untouched.

4. **Handle New Actors**:
   - Insert new records for actors who are not present in `actors_history_scd`.

---

### **Incremental Query for `actors_history_scd`**

Here’s the query:

```sql
WITH current_scd AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        quality_class,
        is_active,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        is_current
    FROM actors_history_scd
    WHERE is_current = TRUE
),
new_data AS (
    SELECT
        a.actorid,
        a.actor,
        a.quality_class,
        a.is_active,
        CURRENT_DATE AS start_date
    FROM actors a
),
changed_records AS (
    SELECT
        c.actorid,
        c.actor,
        c.quality_class AS old_quality_class,
        c.is_active AS old_is_active,
        n.quality_class AS new_quality_class,
        n.is_active AS new_is_active,
        c.start_date,
        CURRENT_DATE - 1 AS end_date
    FROM current_scd c
    JOIN new_data n
      ON c.actorid = n.actorid
    WHERE c.quality_class IS DISTINCT FROM n.quality_class
       OR c.is_active IS DISTINCT FROM n.is_active
),
historical_updates AS (
    -- Mark the current record as historical
    UPDATE actors_history_scd
    SET 
        end_date = cr.end_date,
        is_current = FALSE
    FROM changed_records cr
    WHERE actors_history_scd.actorid = cr.actorid
      AND actors_history_scd.is_current = TRUE
    RETURNING actors_history_scd.actorid
),
new_inserts AS (
    SELECT
        n.actorid,
        n.actor,
        n.quality_class,
        n.is_active,
        n.start_date,
        NULL AS end_date,
        TRUE AS is_current
    FROM new_data n
    LEFT JOIN current_scd c
      ON n.actorid = c.actorid
    WHERE c.actorid IS NULL -- New actor
       OR c.actorid IN (SELECT actorid FROM historical_updates) -- Changed actor
)
-- Insert new records
INSERT INTO actors_history_scd (actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT * FROM new_inserts;
```

---

### **Query Breakdown**

#### **1. Current SCD Data (`current_scd`)**
```sql
SELECT
    actorid,
    quality_class,
    is_active,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    is_current
FROM actors_history_scd
WHERE is_current = TRUE
```
- Retrieves the most recent records from `actors_history_scd` (those marked as `is_current = TRUE`).
- These are the records we will compare against the new data.

---

#### **2. Incoming Data (`new_data`)**
```sql
SELECT
    a.actorid,
    a.actor,
    a.quality_class,
    a.is_active,
    CURRENT_DATE AS start_date
FROM actors a
```
- Selects the current state of actors from the `actors` table.
- Uses `CURRENT_DATE` as the `start_date` for any new or updated records.

---

#### **3. Changed Records (`changed_records`)**
```sql
SELECT
    c.actorid,
    c.actor,
    c.quality_class AS old_quality_class,
    c.is_active AS old_is_active,
    n.quality_class AS new_quality_class,
    n.is_active AS new_is_active,
    c.start_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - 1 AS end_date
FROM current_scd c
JOIN new_data n
  ON c.actorid = n.actorid
WHERE c.quality_class IS DISTINCT FROM n.quality_class
   OR c.is_active IS DISTINCT FROM n.is_active
```
- Identifies actors whose `quality_class` or `is_active` values have changed by comparing the `actors` table with the current SCD data.
- Calculates the `end_date` for the existing record as `CURRENT_DATE - 1`.

---

#### **4. Historical Updates (`historical_updates`)**
```sql
UPDATE actors_history_scd
SET 
    end_date = cr.end_date,
    is_current = FALSE
FROM changed_records cr
WHERE actors_history_scd.actorid = cr.actorid
  AND actors_history_scd.is_current = TRUE
RETURNING actors_history_scd.actorid
```
- Marks the current record as historical by:
  - Setting the `end_date` to the day before the new record’s `start_date`.
  - Updating `is_current` to `FALSE`.

---

#### **5. New Inserts (`new_inserts`)**
```sql
SELECT
    n.actorid,
    n.actor,
    n.quality_class,
    n.is_active,
    n.start_date,
    NULL AS end_date,
    TRUE AS is_current
FROM new_data n
LEFT JOIN current_scd c
  ON n.actorid = c.actorid
WHERE c.actorid IS NULL -- New actor
   OR c.actorid IN (SELECT actorid FROM historical_updates) -- Changed actor
```
- Inserts new records for:
  - Actors who don’t yet exist in `actors_history_scd`.
  - Actors whose records were updated in the previous step (`historical_updates`).

---

#### **6. Final Insertion**
```sql
INSERT INTO actors_history_scd (actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT * FROM new_inserts;
```
- Inserts all new or updated records into the `actors_history_scd` table.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Identify Changes**:
   - Compares `actors` table with `actors_history_scd` to find differences in `quality_class` or `is_active`.
2. **Mark Historical Records**:
   - Updates the `end_date` and marks existing records as historical (`is_current = FALSE`).
3. **Insert New Records**:
   - Inserts new records for changed or new actors.

---

### **Edge Cases Handled**
1. **New Actors**:
   - Automatically inserted with a `start_date` and `is_current = TRUE`.

2. **No Changes**:
   - If `quality_class` and `is_active` remain the same, no updates or inserts occur.

3. **Actors with Changed Data**:
   - Their previous record is marked as historical, and a new record is inserted.

---

ERROR: column "end_date" is of type date but expression is of type text
  tip: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression.
---


The error occurs because you're attempting to insert a `TEXT` value into the `end_date` column, which is of type `DATE`. This often happens when you explicitly set `NULL` or another non-date value without properly casting it to `DATE`.

---

### **Fix: Ensure `NULL` or Other Expressions Are Cast to `DATE`**
When inserting or selecting data for a `DATE` column, ensure all expressions or `NULL` values are explicitly cast to `DATE`.

#### Example Correction in the `new_inserts` CTE:
Here’s the problematic part from the `new_inserts` CTE:
```sql
NULL AS end_date
```

Correct it by explicitly casting `NULL` to `DATE`:
```sql
NULL::DATE AS end_date
```

---

### **Updated Query for New Inserts**
Here’s the corrected part of the `new_inserts` CTE:
```sql
new_inserts AS (
    SELECT
        n.actorid,
        n.actor,
        n.quality_class,
        n.is_active,
        n.start_date,
        NULL::DATE AS end_date,  -- Explicitly cast NULL to DATE
        TRUE AS is_current
    FROM new_data n
    LEFT JOIN current_scd c
      ON n.actorid = c.actorid
    WHERE c.actorid IS NULL -- New actor
       OR c.actorid IN (SELECT actorid FROM historical_updates) -- Changed actor
)
```

---

### **Why This Works**
- PostgreSQL enforces strict data type matching. By explicitly casting `NULL` to `DATE`, it ensures the `NULL` value is compatible with the `end_date` column's type.
- This is a common requirement when inserting into or selecting for columns with specific types.

---

### **Proactive Checks**
If you’re encountering similar errors, review the following:
1. **Field Types**:
   - Ensure all expressions in the `INSERT` query match the column types in `actors_history_scd`.
   - Example:
     - `quality_class` → Should match the `ENUM` type `quality_rating`.
     - `is_active` → Should be `BOOLEAN`.
     - `start_date` and `end_date` → Should be `DATE`.

2. **Casting in Other Queries**:
   - Use `::TYPE` casting where necessary, e.g., `NULL::BOOLEAN`, `NULL::DATE`.

This  last assignment is not filling the end_date and is_current correctly, all the "end_dates" are null for all rows given an actor and also the is_current is always true. This is not correct, the "end_date" should be null and the is_active true only for the last record. Can you check the logic 

---

You're absolutely right—the current logic isn't setting the `end_date` and `is_current` correctly for historical records. The problem lies in how we determine the `end_date` and assign `is_current`. Let's fix this step by step.

---

### **Expected Behavior**
1. **`end_date`**:
   - For historical records, `end_date` should be the day before the `start_date` of the next record.
   - For the most recent record (i.e., `is_current = TRUE`), `end_date` should remain `NULL`.

2. **`is_current`**:
   - Only the latest record for each actor should have `is_current = TRUE`.
   - All other records should have `is_current = FALSE`.

---

### **Fixing the Query**

#### **Key Updates**
We need to fix the following:
1. Properly compute `end_date` using the `LEAD()` function for all records except the last one.
2. Assign `is_current = TRUE` only for the latest record (where `LEAD()` returns `NULL`).

#### **Corrected Query**

```sql
WITH current_scd AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        quality_class,
        is_active,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        is_current
    FROM actors_history_scd
    WHERE is_current = TRUE
),
new_data AS (
    SELECT
        a.actorid,
        a.actor,
        a.quality_class,
        a.is_active,
        CURRENT_DATE AS start_date
    FROM actors a
),
merged_data AS (
    SELECT
        n.actorid,
        n.actor,
        n.quality_class,
        n.is_active,
        n.start_date,
        -- Use LEAD to calculate end_date for historical records
        LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) - 1 AS end_date,
        -- Mark as current only if there is no subsequent record
        CASE 
            WHEN LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) IS NULL THEN TRUE
            ELSE FALSE
        END AS is_current
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM current_scd
        UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM new_data
    ) n
)
-- Insert updated rows into the SCD table
INSERT INTO actors_history_scd (actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current
FROM merged_data;
```

---

### **Key Changes**

#### **1. Use `LEAD()` for `end_date`**
The `LEAD()` function computes the `end_date` as the day before the `start_date` of the next record:
```sql
LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) - 1 AS end_date
```
- The `PARTITION BY n.actorid` ensures that dates are calculated independently for each actor.
- For the last record (where no subsequent record exists), `LEAD()` returns `NULL`, leaving the `end_date` as `NULL`.

---

#### **2. Correctly Set `is_current`**
The `CASE` statement determines the `is_current` value:
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) IS NULL THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
END AS is_current
```
- If `LEAD()` returns `NULL` (last record), `is_current` is set to `TRUE`.
- Otherwise, `is_current` is set to `FALSE`.

---

#### **3. Merging Current and New Data**
To ensure the `actors_history_scd` table reflects the most up-to-date data:
- Combine the `current_scd` and `new_data` datasets using `UNION ALL`:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM current_scd
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM new_data
  ```

---

### **Example**

#### Input (`actors` Table)
| actorid | actor      | quality_class | is_active | current_year |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| A001    | Actor One  | star          | TRUE      | 1970         |
| A001    | Actor One  | good          | TRUE      | 1971         |
| A002    | Actor Two  | average       | FALSE     | 1970         |

#### Result (`actors_history_scd` Table)
| actorid | actor      | quality_class | is_active | start_date | end_date   | is_current |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| A001    | Actor One  | star          | TRUE      | 1970-01-01 | 1970-12-31 | FALSE      |
| A001    | Actor One  | good          | TRUE      | 1971-01-01 | NULL       | TRUE       |
| A002    | Actor Two  | average       | FALSE     | 1970-01-01 | NULL       | TRUE       |

---

### **Testing and Validation**
- **Multiple Records for an Actor**:
  - Ensure transitions are correct (e.g., `end_date` and `is_current` updated properly).
- **Single Record for an Actor**:
  - Ensure `end_date = NULL` and `is_current = TRUE`.
- **Incremental Changes**:
  - Run the query multiple times to verify it correctly handles new and updated records.

---

ERROR: each UNION query must have the same number of columns

---

The error occurs because the two queries combined using `UNION ALL` (`current_scd` and `new_data`) have mismatched column structures. To fix this, ensure both queries have the exact same number of columns, with compatible data types and order.

---

### **Debugging the Issue**
1. **`current_scd` Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       actorid,
       quality_class,
       is_active,
       start_date,
       end_date,
       is_current
   FROM actors_history_scd
   WHERE is_current = TRUE
   ```
   - This query retrieves 6 columns: `actorid`, `quality_class`, `is_active`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_current`.

2. **`new_data` Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       a.actorid,
       a.actor,
       a.quality_class,
       a.is_active,
       CURRENT_DATE AS start_date
   FROM actors a
   ```
   - This query retrieves 5 columns: `actorid`, `actor`, `quality_class`, `is_active`, and `start_date`.

---

### **Solution: Align Columns**
We need to make sure both queries produce the same number of columns in the same order.

#### Updated `new_data` Query
Add placeholders (`NULL`) for the missing columns in `new_data`:
```sql
SELECT
    a.actorid,
    a.actor,
    a.quality_class,
    a.is_active,
    CURRENT_DATE AS start_date,
    NULL::DATE AS end_date,       -- Add end_date with a default NULL value
    TRUE AS is_current            -- Add is_current with a default TRUE value
FROM actors a
```

#### Updated Combined Query (`merged_data`)
Now, the `UNION ALL` can merge `current_scd` and `new_data` properly:
```sql
WITH current_scd AS (
    SELECT
        actorid,
        actor,
        quality_class,
        is_active,
        start_date,
        end_date,
        is_current
    FROM actors_history_scd
    WHERE is_current = TRUE
),
new_data AS (
    SELECT
        a.actorid,
        a.actor,
        a.quality_class,
        a.is_active,
        CURRENT_DATE AS start_date,
        NULL::DATE AS end_date,
        TRUE AS is_current
    FROM actors a
),
merged_data AS (
    SELECT
        n.actorid,
        n.actor,
        n.quality_class,
        n.is_active,
        n.start_date,
        LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) - 1 AS end_date,
        CASE 
            WHEN LEAD(n.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY n.actorid ORDER BY n.start_date) IS NULL THEN TRUE
            ELSE FALSE
        END AS is_current
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM current_scd
        UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM new_data
    ) n
)
-- Insert updated rows into the SCD table
INSERT INTO actors_history_scd (actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT actorid, actor, quality_class, is_active, start_date, end_date, is_current
FROM merged_data;
```

---

### **Key Changes**
1. **Align Columns in `new_data`**:
   - Added `end_date` with `NULL::DATE`.
   - Added `is_current` with `TRUE`.

2. **Matching Columns in `current_scd` and `new_data`**:
   - Both queries now have 7 columns: `actorid`, `actor`, `quality_class`, `is_active`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `is_current`.

3. **Unified Query**:
   - The `UNION ALL` operator now works seamlessly, merging `current_scd` and `new_data`.

---
